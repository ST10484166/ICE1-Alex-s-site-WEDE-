# Alex's World üåç

This is a personal website project I built for my coursework.  
The goal was to practice **HTML** and **CSS** layout techniques, including grid, flexbox, and hover effects.

## üìñ Project Overview
The website is a small introduction to "Alex's World." It includes:
- A **header** with the site title and subtitle.
- A **navigation bar** with links to different sections.
- A **"Fun Facts"** section with quirky information.
- A **main content area** with a personal story and project showcase.
- An **aside (gallery)** with images that expand and reveal text on hover.
- A **footer** with contact details.

## ‚ú® Features
- **CSS Grid Layout** for page structure.
- **Flexbox** in the image gallery for responsive layout.
- **Hover effects**:
  - Cards change background and "levitate."
  - Images enlarge and reveal captions after a delay.
- **Smooth scrolling** between navigation links.
- **Gradient backgrounds** on header and footer for a modern look.

## üñºÔ∏è Sections
- **Projects:** A set of "cards" that showcase different fictional apps like *TaskTide*, *FoodieFinder*, and *FitNest*.  
- **Pictures:** An image gallery with hover animations.  
- **Fun Facts:** Lighthearted facts about Alex.  
- **Contact:** Email, phone, and location (fictional).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS**

## üìö What I Learned
- Structuring a website with semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `aside`, `footer`).
- Using **CSS Grid** to design a responsive page layout.
- Applying **transitions** and **hover effects** for interactivity.
- Writing clean, reusable CSS for styling sections.
- CSS is equally as time consuming as html.

## üìå Use of AI
AI was lightly used in this project, mainly for the handling of hovering images. A link to the conversation can be found [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/68bb3a2b-88bc-8007-93df-9c6f970af1f9)

## Challenges
While working on this project, I encountered some issues along the way. The biggest of which being the hover mechanism. At first I wanted to simply have the whole box hover together, but they were small so I decided to enlarge the image and expose text as well. This took me a long while.
